    "I craeted three Classes: Max heapq, Task, and TaskScheduler. Max heapq implements properties and methods that support a max priority queue data structure. The priority queue will be based on the values of priority values of each subtasks, where subtasks with the highest priority value will be at the root of the priority queue. It will have all the characteristics of a max heap data structure, where parent node will always be bigger than its child nodes. Class Task will store all the information or attributes of the tasks and subtasks. TaskScheduler holds methods that can create a scheduler given inputs. Most of the methods are from CS 110 Session 10: heaps and priority queue, but I heavily revised method run_task_scheduler so that it takes account of dependencies and adjust priority values when necessary. To be specific, it sets the priority value of a task to 99 if the difference between its strict starting time and current time is less than the duration of the current root of the priority queue. The task with strict time constraint will now have the highest priority value, and the method executes build_max_heap that will heapify the whole heap, placing the updated task to the root. \n",
    "\n",
    "Priority queue is a well-suited data structure to prioritize tasks because root of the priority queue will always hold a task with the maximum priority value. That is exactly what a scheduler requires: it needs to decide which task should be executed first. Priority queue is also very useful because heappush and heapify makes efficient insertion and organization of the heap. Thus, with simple modification, adding a new task or updating the priority value in the middle is possible without destroying the sorting. \n",
    "\n",
    "I created a function priority_generator that provides the initial priority values based on the number of dependencies it has, number of other tasks dependent on the task, and duration of the task as shown below. To prevent tasks with strict starting time running before its start time, the generator sets their initial priority values to be 0. The priority values of these tasks will be set to 99 when no tasks can be done between current time and the strict starting time of a task. "

Among the tasks that currently does not have a dependency, the order of the task execution will generally be determined depending on the initial priority value it received from the priority calculation. For instance, among all the tasks with no dependencies initially (Task 1,4,5,6,7,10,13,14,15), Task 7 has the highest priority value (51), so task 7 will run first, followed by task 1 (50). \n",

For instance, task 5 requires me to get to the barbecue restaurant by 11:00 AM, before the restaurant gets crowed by people. The scheduler places task 5 at 11:00 AM even though it has low initial priority value because it increases the priority value when the current time gets close to 11:00 AM."

The attribute will receive a tuple as its input, where the first item is a boolean (True when multi tasking is possible and False otherwise) and the second item is id of a task it can be multi tasked (integer). In addition, I should add a condition inside run_task_scheduler that checks if a popped task can be multi tasked. If it can be multi tasked, it checks the ID of the task it can be multitasked with. Then it should compare their duration and raise the priority value of the multi taskable task if it has a longer duration. Then, it should heapify and pop the root of the priority queue to execute it. Then, it will run the multi taskable task with a shorter duration with the same procedure. Finally, it should subtract the duration of the shorter task from the current time because the shorter task should have been executed at the same time during the execution of the longer task. "

    "The instructions from the assignment helped me create a solid framework for my algorithm and the goal state of my scheduler. The concrete planning allowed me to strategize my algorithm, which allowed it to be more efficient than it would have been if I decided on the spot where to go next. For instance, I might have tried to implement multi-tasking from the beginning if I did not follow the instruction, but my own intuition. If I did so, I would have had a much harder time figuring out where the error is and was much more inefficient. However, following the instruction strictly might have limited me from thinking outside of the box with a new perspective. \n",
    "The schedule is somewhat efficient because it allows me to know a possible schedule given so many input tasks. It is especially helpful because it allows me to know the general order of the tasks and which pairs of tasks can be multi-tasked. The schedule, however, might not be the most efficient order of tasks because it does not consider the physical distance between the locations of tasks and my condition (such as how hungry or tired I am). Thus, I would use the scheduler in my daily life, but I will not strictly follow it because there are many factors like transportation time between tasks that the scheduler does not yet include. \n",
